# SharpGame


## Description

This game is a platformer arena where your goal is to survive for as long as possible either with friends or solo.

Recently I was interested in learning C# language, and because I had experience with Godot in the past I figured out why not use both to make a game. And so I started laying foundation for a simple game.

While creating first scripts I've stumbled upon many minor roadblocks but that wasn't a problem as workarounds while learning are your friends (for the most part).
